# Chatting With Google Analytics App

### Description

In this project I build a chatbot that interacts with Google Analytics data using LangChain, a library for building applications with LLMs. I leverage LangChain chains to extract ROI insights from BigQuery by generating SQL queries and then executing them. I then build a Gradio app that interacts with BigQuery 

### Use Cases

What kind of queries might a user enter and what are the responses the system should give

### System Prompt

What kind of system prompt etc is needed to make the LLM respond in the appropriate why, e.g. response length, style, when not to give an answer etc.
